The human body is an incredibly complex and intricate system, one that still baffles doctors and
researchers on a regular basis despite thousands of years of medical knowledge. As a result, it
shouldn’t be any surprise that even body parts and functions we deal with every day have bizarre
or unexpected facts and explanations behind them. From sneezes to fingernail growth, here are
100 weird, wacky, and interesting facts about the human body.</p>

   Vision. This wonderful sense allows us to image the world around us, from the genius of
Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling to mistfilled vistas of a mountain range. Vision is one of the most delicate and complicated senses.
It is also the most studied. About one-fourth of the brain is involved in visual processing, more than for any
other sense. More is known about vision than any other vertebrate sensory system, with most of the information derived from
studies of monkeys and cats
